Some of the stuff I've worked on includes:

- [`kysrc`](https://www.github.com/alspur/kysrc), an R package with Kentucky School Report Card data from 2012-2017. There's too much data in to be hosted on CRAN, but you can install it with `devtools` by running this command: `devtools::install_github("alspur/kysrc")`
- [*Collaborative Analysis Development in Education Agencies*](https://capstone.alspur.com), part of my capstone project for the [Strategic Data Project Fellowship](http://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu).
- [`marblr`](https://www.github.com/alspur/marblr), an R package that scrapes NCAA Division I Football game data from 1995 to present, then creates a simple and fair ranking system to determine which teams ought to have had a shot at a championship.
- More to come...
