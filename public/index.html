     <p>The college football playoff selection process is broken. The current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff">College Football Playoff (CFP)</a> was created to address the shortcomings of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series">Bowl Championship Series (BCS)</a>. Under the BCS system, a combination of polls and computer rankings were used to select two teams to play for the national championship. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series_controversies">controversial nature of the BCS system is well-documented</a>, but its greatest flaw was allowing a season to end with an undefeated team that did not have a chance to play for a championship.</p>
<p>The CFP was created to address the major problems of the BCS. Instead of using polls and computer takings to determine two teams to play for a national championship, the CFP relies on a selection committee to create a four-team playoff each year to determine the national champion. The selection committee’s ability to apply more subjective criteria was intended to prevent BCS-style controversy, but the past two seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff#Criticism">similar controversy surrounding the selection of teams</a>. In a throwback to the BCS days, the 2017-2018 college football season ended with an undefeated team (Central Florida) that was not allowed to compete in the CFP.</p>
<p>In response to the flaws of the CFP system, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/iowahawkblog">David Burge</a> proposed an easy-to-comprehend alternative approach to determine which NCAA football teams would be invited to the four-team playoff called the “Marble Game.” The motivation behind the Marble Game is clear:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The point of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarbleGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarbleGame</a> is that CFB playoff selection could be simple, open, &amp; transparent, not backroom committees lobbying for the outcome of a beauty contest.</p>&mdash; David Burge (@iowahawkblog) <a href="https://twitter.com/iowahawkblog/status/937352469511835650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The rules of the Marble Game are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each team starts with a pre-determined amount of marbles.</li>
<li>If a team wins a home game, they take 20% of the loser’s marbles.</li>
<li>If a team wins a road game, they take 25% of the loser’s marbles.</li>
<li>Neutral site games are treated as home wins for the victor (20% marble transfer).</li>
<li>At the end of the season, the four teams with the most marbles are invited to participate in the CFP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these rules, I created an R package, <a href="https://www.github.com/alspur/marblr"><code>marblr</code></a>, to simulate the results of the Marble Game. The <code>marblr</code> package uses game data scraped from <a href="https://www.masseyratings.com/data.php">Massey Ratings</a> to simulate the Marble Game using Burge’s rules. Additionally, the <code>marblr</code> package allows for simulations that grant extra weight to teams from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences">Power Five conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, SEC, plus Notre Dame)</a>. As a default, teams from the Power Five start with 120 marbles, while all other teams start with 100.</p>

<p>The plot above illustrates the outcome of the Marble Game for each NCAA Division I FBS football team<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The first ten weeks of the season are very noisy - it’s hard to discern a clear top tier of teams - but a distinct cohort of competitive teams begins to separate from the pack between weeks 10 and 15. At the end of week 15, conference championships have been played and final bowl and CFP selections are made.</p>
<p>We know that Alabama, Georgia, Clemson, and Oklahoma were selected to play in the CFP for the 2017-2018 season, but which teams would have been invited to the CFP via the Marble Game?</p>

<p>According to the Marble Game, Ohio State and Central Florida (the lone undefeated team) would have received CFP invites over Georgia and Alabama - teams that both won their first-round CFP games and made the national championship game in 2017-2018. Knowing what we know now, it would be silly to have excluded Alabama and Georgia from the CFP.</p>
<p>Ideally, the Marble Game would be used to determine teams for an 8-team college football playoff. Under this system, each Power Five conference has a strong chance for their champion to make the playoff. Conferences with more strength at the top (like the SEC and Big Ten in 2017-2018) would be able to send multiple teams to the playoff based on their marble count. Such a playoff would have created the following first-round games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clemson (1 seed, ACC) vs. Wisconsin (8 seed, Big Ten)</li>
<li>Ohio State (2 seed, Big Ten) vs. Alabama (7 seed, SEC)</li>
<li>Oklahoma (3 seed, Big 12) vs. USC (6 seed, Pac-12)</li>
<li>UCF (4 seed, AAC) vs. Georgia (5 seed, SEC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This bracket would resolve the controversy following this year’s selections. Each major conference is represented, stronger conferences have multiple contenders, and a non-Power Five team was able to enter based on the marbles they accumulated through an undefeated regular season.</p>

<div id="moving-forward" class="section level2">
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>College football deserves a better process for determining a national champion. There are simply too many seasons with more than four teams with a solid case to compete in a playoff. While the calendar and physical constraints prevent the development of a March Madness-style bracket in college football, expanding the CFP to an 8-team format could mitigate most of the controversy generated under past systems.</p>
<p>The CFP could continue their process of a selection committee, but the Marble Game is an attractive substitute. It places more weight and importance on winning late-season games - games that are either conference championships or rivalry games. It also would discourage programs from scheduling “cupcake” games; playing strong opponents would mean more opportunity to increase your marble count. Most importantly, the criteria for advancing to the playoff would be transparent, consistent, and fair to all teams.</p>
<p>It’ll never happen, but it’s a fun idea to consider.</p>

     <div class="article-content">
        
     <p>A few months ago, RStudio announced the release of <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><code>blogdown</code></a>, a package that allows you to generate and maintain a Hugo blog using R and RStudio. I’ve hosted my blog on Github Pages using Jekyll for a few years, but the opportunity to make my blog more R-friendly was really appealing. I downloaded the package and started tinkering with the stock template.</p>

<p>Since I wrote all of my blog posts in markdown, it was easy to add my posts to the stock Hugo theme in <code>blogdown</code>  and immediately see my content rendered via Hugo. It would have been easy for me to flip the switch and get a new version of my blog up and running on Github Pages, but I wasn’t fully satisfied with any of the available themes. I know enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous, but not enough to create a working custom Hugo theme in an afternoon.</p>

<p>Every few weeks since the initial announcement of <code>blogdown</code>, I tinkered around with customizing a Hugo theme for my blog, but didn’t really commit the time to get it done until the week between Christmas and New Year. Starting with <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme"><code>blogdown creator</code> Yihui’s version of the Lithium theme</a> and using <a href="https://github.com/jsonbecker/jsonbecker-hugo">Jason Becker’s json.blog theme</a> as a guide, I took some of the concepts from my old blog and created my own twist on a Hugo theme. Yihui’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code> book</a> helped me to really understand the underpinnings of how <code>blogdown</code> works and how to get my blog hosted on <a href="http://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>

<p>The ability to host my blog on Netlify was a big selling point for me. Not only did it allow my blog to use HTTPS (a benefit unavailable to users of Github Pages), it also allowed me to simply push source files to Github and it would render the site update <em>automatically</em>. I loved this feature with Github Pages and Jekyll and it was a must-have for me to make the switch to <code>blogdown</code> and Hugo. This feature allows me to create and publish a post from my iPhone or one of my iPads (<a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/27">#multipadlifestyle</a>) - no laptop required. In fact, this post started on my iPhone via <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a>, then moved to <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> and was published via <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> and <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> on my iPad Pro. A good deal of my writing will be done in R Markdown moving forward, but I love having the ability to publish with an entirely iOS workflow.</p>

<p>The <code>blogdown</code> version of my blog is up and running, and I’m really happy with the results. If you’re an R user and want to either start a blog or are thinking about a move from Jekyll to Hugo, I’d <em>highly</em> recommend using <code>blogdown</code>.</p>

     <p>What impact does a high-quality superintendent have on student performance? A new NBER paper by Victor Lavy and Adi Boiko investigates this question using data from schools in Israel, finding a significant effect on student achievement (.04 SD) for top-quality superintendents. From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We exploit a quasi-random matching of superintendent and schools, and estimate that superintendent value added has positive and significant effects on primary and middle school students’ test scores in math, Hebrew, and English. One standard deviation improvement in superintendent value added increases test scores by about 0.04 of a standard deviation in the test score distribution. The effect doesn’t vary with students’ socio-economic background, is highly non-linear, increases sharply for superintendents in the highest-quartile of the value added distribution, and is larger for female superintendents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did top-quality superintendents achieve these results? By improving the focus and clarity of school priorities and procedures, with an emphasis on improving school climate. The authors note the similarity of this management approach to <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/2014_injecting_charter_school_best_practices_into_traditional_public_schools.pdf">Fryer&rsquo;s 2014 study of Houston schools adopting a charter-style &ldquo;no excuses&rdquo; approach</a>.</p>

<p>The results of this study, along with Fryer&rsquo;s 2014 study, should inform the training and practice of superintendents in the United States. While successful superintendents will also likely need to develop and demonstrate competency in instructional leadership, finance, HR, and legal matters, the value-add of strength in these domains isn&rsquo;t as clear. Superintendents have the most impact on student outcomes when they help bring focus and clarity to schools while also emphasizing strong school culture. The leaders and programs that embrace this approach are likely to deliver better outcomes for their students in the long run.</p>

     <p>Do low-stakes international assessments of student performance accurately describe student ability? According to this recent NBER Working paper, a country&rsquo;s results may depend on their students&rsquo; intrinsic motivation to do well.</p>

<p>The authors used an experimental approach that offered treatment students a small financial incentive to do well on a test. Students in the treatment group were told just before the test that an envelope with the equivalent of $25 (US) was theirs, but that $1 would be subtracted for each incorrect answer. The researchers conducted the experiment in three high schools in China and two in the US. They found no impact of the financial incentive in China, but the effect size in the US was 0.20-0.23 standard deviations.</p>

<p>The authors conclude that the massive difference in treatment effect between countries indicates that &ldquo;success on low states assessments does not solely reflect differences in ability between students across countries&rdquo; and that &ldquo;low-stakes tests do not measure and compare ability in isolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this in mind, researchers, policymakers, and the public should be a little more cautious when interpreting the results of low-stakes assessments like PISA. Student motivation clearly plays a significant role in the results of a country&rsquo;s performance - a topic that deserves further investigation. For example, NCES will release new <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">NAEP results</a> in early 2018. Does student motivation vary significantly for NAEP across state lines? If so, how much of a role (if any) is it contributing to state performance?</p>

<p>Low-stakes assessments can be informative, but they may be measuring more than student ability. This study is a reminder to policymakers and advocates to exercise caution when comparing performance on these tests across jurisdictions.</p>

     <p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a> recently interviewed <a href="https://twitter.com/Atul_Gawande">Atul Gawande</a> on his podcast, <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/commentary/conversations-tyler">Conversations with Tyler</a>. It’s a great episode and worth listening to the whole thing, but one section in particular stood out to me. From the <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/atul-gawande-checklist-books-tyler-cowen-d8268b8dfe53">transcript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>COWEN: What’s the number one thing missing in medical education today, for doctors?</p>

<p>GAWANDE: I think the number one thing is an education around the fact that we are no longer a craft. It’s no longer an individual craft of being the smartest, most experienced, and capable individual. It’s a profession that has exceeded the capabilities of any individual to manage the volume of knowledge and skill required. So we are now delivering as groups of people. And knowing how to be an effective group, how to solve problems when your group is not being effective, and to enable that capability—that, I think, is not being taught, it’s not being researched. It is the biggest opportunity to advance human health, and we’re not delivering on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having worked in the education sector for a decade, it’s hard to listen to that and not consider replacing “medical education” with “educator preparation” and “human health” with “student outcomes.”</p>

<p>Teaching is certainly a craft that requires significant training, practice, and experience to master, but it also requires a high degree of collaboration with other teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and students. Similar to medicine, it’s an under-taught, under-researched aspect of the profession.</p>
