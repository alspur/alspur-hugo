<p>The <a href="https://www.premierlacrosseleague.com">Premiere Lacrosse League (PLL)</a> is attempting a new model for a professional team sport: a tour-based schedule with the entire six-team league playing in a different city each weekend. Paired with their <a href="https://www.premierlacrosseleague.com/launch-announcement">NBC partnership</a>, more people will get to see high-quality lacrosse than a city-based league like the MLL could attain.</p>

<p>This week, the PLL announced a list of 30 cities that are in the running to be one of the 12 final sites for PLL games this summer. The map includes cities from coast-to-coast, as well as a pair of Canadian cities. Having grown up playing lacrosse in Minnesota and doing some coaching in Kentucky, I’m excited to see a lot of non-traditional lacrosse areas on the map. It seems clear that the PLL is serious about expanding interest in the game beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor">Acela corridor</a>.</p>

<p>The big question - how should the PLL decide which cities to host game weekends during their inaugural season?</p>

<p>My proposal would be to divide the map into four regions, then to select three cities from each region. The four regions would be: Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. It would allow for representation in traditional hotbeds, but the bulk of the cities (75%) would be in areas where youth lacrosse has the highest rates of growth.</p>

<p>Here’s my breakdown of each region:</p>

<h2 id="northeast">Northeast</h2>

<p>Cities: Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Providence, Toronto, Washington DC</p>

<p>This region is rich with lacrosse tradition, which makes it difficult to cut any of these cities. I think right off the bat, New York has to be on the final list. Ignoring the media opportunities/exposure of the Big Apple, it would also give the league a chance to show the great work and impact of organizations working to expand access to the sport, such as <a href="https://www.harlemlacrosse.org">Harlem Lacrosse</a>.</p>

<p>With NYC off the table, that leaves us with two cities to select from three pretty distinct sub-regions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mid-Atlantic: Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington DC</li>
<li>New England: Boston, Hartford, Providence</li>
<li>Upstate: Albany, Buffalo, Toronto</li>
</ul>

<p>With all due respect to the Upstate cities, I think the remaining two cities should come from the other sub-regions. Baltimore is an easy pick here - it’s where PLL partner STX is headquartered and is home to some of the best lacrosse programs at every age level.</p>

<p>Out of the New England sub-region, I’d go with a smaller city: Hartford. As a <a href="https://www.trincoll.edu">Trinity alum</a> and former Hartford resident, I’m a little biased. <em>HOWEVER</em> - the UConn football stadium will be the site of a <a href="http://dailycampus.com/stories/2017/4/19/hartford-to-host-2019-march-madness-rentchler-field-gets-2021-mens-lacrosse-title-game">men’s lacrosse NCAA quarterfinal game this spring as well as the 2021 and 2022 Men’s NCAA lacrosse championship games</a>. Seems like a natural fit for the PLL!</p>

<p><strong>Final cities: Hartford, New York, Baltimore</strong></p>

<h2 id="south-region">South Region</h2>

<p>Cities: Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Orlando, Raleigh, Richmond</p>

<p>Let’s break these down into sub-regions again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Old South: Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, Richmond</li>
<li>Florida: Miami, Orlando</li>
<li>Texas: Dallas, Houston</li>
</ul>

<p>I think both the Florida and Texas regions are a coin-flip, but the PLL really should have one city in each of these states. In the Old South, I’d lean towards Atlanta. If it’s good enough for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Championship_Game">SEC football championship game</a>, it ought to be good enough for the PLL.</p>

<p><strong>Final Cities: Atlanta, Houston, Orlando</strong></p>

<h2 id="midwest">Midwest</h2>

<p>Cities: Chicago, Cincinnati, Columbus, Minneapolis, St. Louis</p>

<p>Minnesota and Ohio are the only states in this region with <a href="https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/about-us-lacrosse/participation-survey-2017.pdf">more than 10,000 youth lacrosse participants</a>, so they each get a weekend. In Ohio, I’ll give Cincinnati the nod solely because it’s a shorter drive from where I’m typing in Louisville.</p>

<p>That leaves us with a choice between Chicago and St. Louis - the Second City makes sense here.</p>

<p><strong>Final Cities: Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis</strong></p>

<h2 id="west">West</h2>

<p>The PLL headquarters are in Los Angeles, so it’s fairly obvious that it’ll be on the final list. Since I also think there ought to be a maximum of only one city per state, that rules out San Francisco.</p>

<p>This leaves two distinct areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pacific Northwest: Portland, Seattle, Vancouver</li>
<li>Mountains: Denver, Salt Lake City</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not super-familiar with the lacrosse scene in the Pacific Northwest, so let’s give it to the lone Canadian city. In the Mountains, I could see this going either way, but I’ll go with the home of the nation’s <a href="https://utahutes.com/news/2017/6/15/general-utah-adds-mens-lacrosse-as-an-ncaa-sport.aspx">newest DI men’s lacrosse program, Utah</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Final Cities: Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Vancouver</strong></p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>My choices are certainly not as thougthful as what the PLL will eventually decide, but it was a fun exercise. It will be interesting to see how the final sites are balanced between the four regions that I identified. It would be shocking if there were not three cities in both the West and the South, but I would not be shocked if there were only two in the Midwest and five in the Northeast.</p>

<p>Regardless of the final outcome, I&rsquo;m looking forward to the announcements of the final schedule, the teams, and most importantly, the first games in June.</p>
