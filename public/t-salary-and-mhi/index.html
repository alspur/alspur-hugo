<p>The most recent data from the American Community Survey show that the Median Household Income (MHI) in Kentucky to be $46,535. In the 2018-19 school year, the average certified salary for Kentucky teachers was $57,819 - a difference of $11,284. However, household income and teacher salaries vary across communities in Kentucky. In most of the state, teachers earn more in salary than the median household, but there are communities where those dollar amounts are the same and in a handful of the state&rsquo;s most affluent communities, teachers earn less than the median household&rsquo;s income.</p>

<p>In the state&rsquo;s largest district, Jefferson County (Louisville), teachers earned $69,674 while the median household earned about $52,237 - a difference of $17,437. In neighboring Oldham county (the most affluent in the state) teachers earned an average of $56,118 in a community where the MHI is $92,273.</p>

<p>There are only 4 counties in Kentucky where the average teacher&rsquo;s salary is less than 90% the county&rsquo;s MHI. These are also happen to be the counties with the highest MHI: Oldham, Boone, Spencer, and Scott.</p>

<p>On the other side, there are 50 districts where teachers are earning at least 50% more than the median household in their counties, representing 17.4% of certified teacher FTEs.</p>

<p>In the majority of districts, teachers representing 58% of certified FTEs earned 10-50% more than the MHI in their counties.</p>

<p><img src="/files/ratio_map.png" alt="ratio-map" /></p>

<p>1 in 4 of Kentucky&rsquo;s certified teachers earns a salary similar to or less than the MHI of their employer&rsquo;s county, which means <strong>75% of certified teachers in Kentucky earn at least 10% more than the median household in the community they serve.</strong></p>

<p>Why does this matter?</p>

<p>Kentucky has seen several days of teacher &ldquo;sickouts&rdquo; during this school year. These quasi-strikes have been in protest of changes to pension laws, pension governing boards, tax credit scholarship legislation, and a bill to change the process for hiring principals in Jefferson County.</p>

<p>Setting aside the merits of these policy stances, it&rsquo;s important to consider the impact of &ldquo;sickouts&rdquo; on students and families. These disruptions to learning happen with little notice and for three quarters of the state, it&rsquo;s done by public employees who out-earn the median household in which they work.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27Ãªtre"><em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em></a> for these school closures is often only tangentially connected to improving outcomes for kids. When it&rsquo;s led by professionals earning more - sometimes significantly more - than the families they serve, quasi-strikes of teachers may actually <em>reduce</em> support for their policy goals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big supporter of teachers - I was a public school teacher and my sister has made it her career. But I&rsquo;d caution them to think about the impact of school shutdowns on kids and families before utilizing that tactic to achieve a policy goal.</p>
